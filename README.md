# Widget Menu

This plugin allows lots of widget buttons to be placed in a dropdown list so
that they don't clutter the main toolbar.

Place this button into the toolbar within a Group with other buttons. Each
button in the group will be removed from the main toolbar and added into a
dropdown menu provided by this button.
